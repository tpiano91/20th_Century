# Building a Historical Network Analysis: International Relations in the 20th Century

###### This project was completed as a requirement for the course, Data Visualizations with Python, by CareerFoundry as part of their Data Analytics Certificate Program.

## Project Objective

##### As a freelance analyst contracted by the Institute for Public Policy to give an analytical overview and visualization of the interrelations between countries throughout the twentieth century. Given the volatility of world politics, the Institute is looking for historical ties between different countries to inform its research.

##### Many new job positions seek freelancers, so you’ll need to choose which tools you’ll use to structure your schedule and complete the assigned task. As a freelancer, some of the most common tasks you’ll receive will require you to create visualizations to share your results. Academic institutions, startups, and other companies hire freelance data analysts to interpret and explain data that can help fit into the context of larger projects.

## Context

##### For this project, the Institute for Public Policy has employed you to analyze and create a visualization as part of a larger initiative it’s working on.

##### In this scenario, the institute believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. To delve deeper into this hypothesis, a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century is needed.

##### Suitable results can be achieved by looking at major global events throughout the twentieth century. To do so, you’ll need to give a visualization and an analysis of the chain of events that led to the current state of affairs. To be effective, your visualization must highlight these past relationships. This way, other researchers can understand and tie your findings into the final report.
